## 1) I hope to make a visual novel covering different shape people with two storylines. 
   2) The objectives will be to save a mysterious village called, "Squareville" by finding the vilage's secret treasure and preventing it from falling into enemy hands. Two storylines are planned; one being the village is saved, and the other one being the village becomes destroyed and the treasure going haywire. There won't be a score, but there's a clear win/or lose pathway you can follow. 
   3) The player will interact with the game by choosing between two dialogue choices or actions, depending on the given situation. Since the game is a visual novel, there won't be as much direct movement like bullet-hells and rogue-lites.    4) I'll include a prototype of a shape person and a house -- representing "Squareville". I'll make a quick, watered version of the story by having the one person presenting two text-boxes. If you click either box, the game will immediately end, either showing "you won!" or "you lost!".
