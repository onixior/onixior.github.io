<p>this is html</p>

# the p tag is used to indicate text. angle brackets are tags. the whole phrase is called an element. 

- the indicator for the tag ending is the / symbol. 


<p id="x">this is html</p>

# the first half is the attribute. the x is exta info that doesn't get shown on the website. 



<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en">
	<head> 
	    <title>hello world</title>
  
        </head>
	<body> 
		<!-- this is a comment -->
		<h1>welcome to my html page!</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>this is my first html page</p>
       		<p>second paragraph</p>
		<span><short</span> 

 </body>
   </html> 


## the doctype is the beginning of entering html format but the actual beginning indicator is the <html tag. you can make it easier to read with indenting. 

* the body is info shown on the actual website. the head shows information at the beginning of the website.
* all html pages need a title.
