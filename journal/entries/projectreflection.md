the tatte website had interesting layouts for their food presentations on the homepage. i inserted this into my website by adding larger, "header"-like pictures, replicating the tatte website. in all three websites, i noticed that there was always a short saying on the homepages, in which i also added on mines! presentations of food and drinks are always shown from drop-down menus, and since the layout is convenient, i added one to my page as well. by utilizing pictures and displays of food and drinks, all three of the sites can reach traction with their customers with a user-friendly system! once again following inspiration, i was motivated to make my website easy to travel through, and not too clustered. 

my experience with wordpress was satisfying as a whole! even though finding out certain parts of templates and patterns was difficult (i still don't fully understand it), i got past certain hardships and learned how to further navigate the editing process! adding pictures and certain design elements, such as separators, became almost instinctive to alter. i definitely found the pre-existing templates helpful, and they saved a lot of time from having to manually implement certan key element features. if i were to make another wordpress website again, i'd definitely play more with the color themes and find ways to add videos and not only pictures to my website.
