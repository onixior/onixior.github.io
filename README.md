the importance of using vim and markdown softwares is crucial with modern techology and surface interfaces. vim, though preferred only by some, allows for easy transitional accessibility to writing commands and overlooking files onto github. markdown allows us to write seamlessly, easy paragraphs.

so far, i'm feeling good with using vim and markdown and it has become second hand nature at this point. markdown will be helpful for my future website, as i originally intended for it to be in a blog-like format! 

advice for future students: practice is key, and understanding and not only memorizing the functionality behind these shortcuts is key to developing. it's a very trial and error based learning style, so mistakes are only signs of proper incentive and shouldn't be dwelved on too much. thanks for reading!
