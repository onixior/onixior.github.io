	<h2 style="color:SaddleBrown;">tips and tricks!</h2>
		<ul>
		  <li>remember to use fresh strawberries! leave them in a baking soda - honey water mixture, and leave to sit for at least a whole day. this enchances the flavor!</li>
		  <li>leave the cake to sit, and then decorate! decorating while hot leads to the toppings and cream melting.</li>
		  <li>to prevent the strawberries from melting onto the cake, spread a thin layer of chocolate ganache before applying the fruits! the chocolate acts as a sealant !</li>
		</ul>
