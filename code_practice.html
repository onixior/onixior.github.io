   <hr>
   <p>available for anybody to use regardless of their computer, the terminal allows for an endless amount of opportunities to directly<em>communicate</em> with the computer. it's essentially an input-based program that uses <strong>code</strong> as its primary way of interpretation and interaction.</p>
   <h1>why we use the terminal.</h1>
   <hr>
   <ul> 
     <li>we can automate repetitive tasks and processes.</li>
     <li>we can use it to develop software such as html!</li>
     <li>it's super convienent and is already a part of the computer.</li>
     <li>we can have more access to commands and provide shortcuts for navigation.<li>
   </ul>
<hr>
 <p>wow, this sounds super cool!<br>what specific commands can we use?</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>command</th>
    <th>purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mkdir</td>
    <td>make a directory within the desktop or repository.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cd</td>
    <td>move to directory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>vim</td>
    <td>enable shortcuts and navigation easier. we can also make files with :wq.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>cat / less</td>
    <td>either can be used to open file contents</td> 
  </tr>
</table> 
<hr>
<p>these aren't the only commands however!<br>research and experiment with more, with knowing these basic navigation tools.</p> 
 <h2>some examples of commands.</h2>
<hr>
<p><code>cd Documents</code><br>we just moved to the directory, documents! as shown, moving around our computer is convienent thanks to the terminal.</p>
<hr>
<p>here's a whole sequence of moving to the directory, "arlington career center", and opening our class as a file! (web design and development).</p>
<hr>
<pre>cd arlington career center
ls arlington career center
cat web design and development</pre>
<hr>
<p>here's an error we might face when attempting to <ul>move</ul> to files.</p>
<kbd>cd web design and development</kbd>
<samp>error: cannot move to files.</samp>
<hr>
<p>this wraps up the beginning essentials for immersing into the possibilities of the terminal.<br>feel free to learn more and practice some of the commands covered in this lesson. good luck!</p>
