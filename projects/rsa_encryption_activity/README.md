### decryption and encryption activity markdown journal 

## the difference betweeb symmetric and assymmetric involve the keys used. symmetric encryption requires one key shared by both computers. assymmetric, on the other hand, requires two: the public key and the secret key. 

## two devices share information between each other. one acts as the reciever, and the other acts as the sender. the sender, before trasnmitting info to the other computer, encrypts its message using the other key's public key. the inforamtion is sent, and the reciever uses its secret key to decrypt the following message. 

## if anybody has access to our secret keys, they'll have the ability to decrypt all of our encrypted messages, which may contain sensitive information.
